# Why not to use a monorepo

## Checklist

- Packages that your team are developing are unlikely to share code between
  each other
- Packages have varying project-related setup, consolidating that wouldn't be
  worthwhile
- Project setup/configuration is automated for you so you don't have to worry
  about it (yay! ðŸŽ‰)
